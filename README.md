## [Deep learning based action recognition from EEG data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VMyxcNFLqI4_RjZq4eXUpDoOc6VcNL_0/view?usp=sharing)

- Explored various CNN, RNN, Conv-Recurrent Net architectures in Keras.
- Implemented data prepossess-ing techniques like Windowed cropping, Sub-sampling to obtain the best performance of 67% with stackedGRU compared to a base line model of 46%

## [SpaceInvaders using Deep RL](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LK7imLVNnEO9X33blALxWWLUqAv35E5i/view?usp=sharing)

- Implemented Dueling, Double DQN to play Atari Space Invaders game in tensorflow.
- Dueling DQN learnedbetter hiding strategy than Double DQN when trained for similar duration of time in both RAM andPixel versions of the game.
- They achieved an average score of 351.1 and 291.1 respectively.

## [Deep RL vs MPC for Path Tracking](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UU8ObBYB7dyocAuKyLFRofEqxkdkyVye/view?usp=sharing)

- Designed Deep RL based controller for Unicycle vehicle model using the DDPG algorithm to achieve continuous control in PyTorch.
- DDPG is more robust to action space noise than baseline LTV-MPC algorithm.
